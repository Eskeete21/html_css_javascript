In this tutorial, we go over how to create a music player in javascript html and css. This tutorial will cover how to play audio in javascript, create a slider that moves with the audio, create buttons with icons from fontawesome, switch between songs with next and play, and style the music player.

- Add fontawesome cdn to your html page: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. First, you should change the class name to use fa-circle-pause when the music is playing, and then switch it back to fa-circle-play when the music is paused. Next, the next song should automatically play after the current song finishes. Finally, you can add functionalities for the shuffle and repeat button. Currently the songs go in order with prev and next. WIth shuffle enabled, the next song will be a random song in the list instead of the one that is directly after it. The same applies for prev song. And if repeat is enabled, instead of changing songs, the song will be repeated when it is done playing.
